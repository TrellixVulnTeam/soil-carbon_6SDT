	This roughcut web application is intended to illustrate both the baseline and
	real-time environmental measurements on possible concessions. The front-end
	is simple.  A fancy user interface or graphics can be built.  The objective
	of this early application is to settle on the measurements that are most
	useful for reporting and prioritization.  The data are not sufficient.  They
	are not updated frequently enough and they are not published at high enough
	spatial resolution to make economic decisions.  At the very least, this web
	application can highlight the data gaps.
