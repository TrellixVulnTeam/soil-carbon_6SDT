	### Data Sources

	#### [Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation](https://gedi.umd.edu) (GEDI)

	GEDI is high resolution laser ranging of Earthâ€™s forests and topography from
	the International Space Station (ISS).  The first major paper published based
	on these data was the Popotov (2020) [dataset on global tree
	height](https://glad.umd.edu/dataset/gedi).  There are dozens of additional
	derived datasets on the three-dimensional structure of forests, and
	calibration of existing optical imagery. (e.g., *Highly Local Model
	Calibration with a New GEDI LiDAR Asset on Google Earth Engine Reduces
	Landsat Forest Height Signal Saturation*, [Healy
	(2020)](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/17/2840)).

	#### [Harmonized global maps of above and belowground biomass carbon density in the year 2010](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0444-4)

	This dataset provides temporally consistent and harmonized global maps of
	aboveground and belowground biomass carbon density for the year 2010 at a
	300-m spatial resolution. The aboveground biomass map integrates land-cover
	specific, remotely sensed maps of woody, grassland, cropland, and tundra
	biomass. Input maps were amassed from the published literature and, where
	necessary, updated to cover the focal extent or time period. The belowground
	biomass map similarly integrates matching maps derived from each aboveground
	biomass map and land-cover specific empirical models. Aboveground and
	belowground maps were then integrated separately using ancillary maps of
	percent tree cover and landcover and a rule-based decision tree. Maps
	reporting the accumulated uncertainty of pixel-level estimates are also
	provided.

	#### [UNEP-WCMC Biomass Dataset](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2019.0128)

	This dataset represents above- and below-ground terrestrial carbon storage
	(tonnes (t) of C per hectare (ha)) for circa 2010. The dataset was
	constructed by combining the most reliable publicly available datasets and
	overlaying them with the ESA CCI landcover map for the year 2010 (ESA, 2017),
	assigning to each grid cell the corresponding above-ground biomass value from
	the biomass map that was most appropriate for the grid cell's landcover type.
	Input carbon datasets were identified through a literature review of existing
	datasets on biomass carbon in terrestrial ecosystems published in
	peer-reviewed literature. To determine which datasets to combine to produce
	the global carbon density map, identified datasets were evaluated based on
	resolution, accuracy, biomass definition and reference date (see Table 1 in
	paper cited for further information on datasets selected). After aggregating
	each selected dataset to a nominal scale of 300 m resolution, forest
	categories in the CCI ESA 2010 landcover dataset were used to extract
	above-ground biomass from Santoro et al. 2018 for forest areas. Woodland and
	savanna biomass were then incorporated for Africa from Bouvet et al. 2018.,
	and from Santoro et al. 2018 for areas outside of Africa and outside of
	forest. Biomass from croplands, sparse vegetation and grassland landcover
	classes from CCI ESA, in addition to shrubland areas outside Africa missing
	from Santoro et al. 2018, were extracted from were extracted from Xia et al.
	2014. and Spawn et al. 2017 averaged by ecological zone for each landcover
	type. Below-ground biomass were added using root-to-shoot ratios from the
	2006 IPCC guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (IPCC, 2006). No
	below-ground values were assigned to croplands as ratios were unavailable.
	Above-and-below-ground biomass were then summed together and multiplied by
	0.5 to convert to carbon, generating a single above-and-below-ground biomass
	carbon layer. This dataset has not been validated.

	#### [Global, 30-m resolution continuous fields of tree cover](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17538947.2013.786146)

	The Landsat Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) tree cover layers contain
	estimates of the percentage of horizontal ground in each 30-m pixel covered
	by woody vegetation greater than 5 meters in height. The dataset is available
	for four epochs centered on the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2015. The dataset
	is derived from the GFCC Surface Reflectance product (GFCC30SR), which is
	based on enhanced Global Land Survey (GLS) datasets. The GLS datasets are
	composed of high-resolution Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7
	Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images at 30 meter resolution.

	Tree cover, the proportional, vertically projected area of vegetation
	(including leaves, stems, branches, etc.) of woody plants above a given
	height, affects terrestrial energy and water exchanges, photosynthesis and
	transpiration, net primary production, and carbon and nutrient fluxes. Tree
	cover also affects habitat quality and movements of wildlife, residential
	property value for humans, and other ecosystem services. The continuous
	classification scheme of the VCF product enables better depiction of land
	cover gradients than traditional discrete classification schemes. Importantly
	for detection and monitoring of forest changes (e.g., deforestation and
	degradation), tree cover provides a measurable attribute upon which to define
	forest cover and its changes. Changes in tree cover over time can be used to
	monitor and retrieve site-specific histories of forest change.

	#### [High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/342/6160/850)

	Results from time-series analysis of Landsat images in characterizing global
	forest extent and change from 2000 through 2019. Trees are defined as
	vegetation taller than 5m in height and are expressed as a percentage per
	output grid cell as â€˜2000 Percent Tree Coverâ€™. â€˜Forest Cover Lossâ€™ is defined
	as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest
	state, during the period 2000â€“2019. â€˜Forest Cover Gainâ€™ is defined as the
	inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the period
	2000â€“2012. â€˜Forest Loss Yearâ€™ is a disaggregation of total â€˜Forest Lossâ€™ to
	annual time scales. Reference 2000 and 2019 imagery are median observations
	from a set of quality assessment-passed growing season observations.

	#### [Costa Rica National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI)](http://sinamecc.opendata.junar.com/dashboards/21151/inventario-nacional-de-gases-de-efecto-invernadero-ingei/)

	The National Inventory of Greenhouse Gases (INGEI) counts the gases emitted
	and absorbed from the atmosphere during a calendar year for the Costa Rican
	territory, according to the guidelines established by the Intergovernmental
	Group of Experts on Climate Change (IPCC).  Note; The inventories for 1990,
	1996 and 2000 are not comparable as they were calculated with a different
	methodology than the recent inventories. They are currently being
	recalculated to be comparable. Privileged access is available through the
	current Ministry of the Environment.
