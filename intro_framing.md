	### Introduction and framing

	A sole focus on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is not
	sufficient to mitigate the existential threat of climate change. Net removal
	of GHGs is paramount to slow the warming of the planet. When considering the
	scale of change that needs to be accomplished in the next decade,
	nature-based solutions for carbon removal, such as reforestation, afforestation,
	and regenerative agriculture, are by far the most mature and scalable at this
	time.

	Regenerative agriculture in particular has garnered significant attention as a
	potential pathway to transform the agricultural sector from a significant source
	of global GHG emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, to a
	global carbon sink.

	estimates the global soil carbon stock down to a depth of 2 meters contains 2047
	Pg of soil organic carbon and 1558 Pg of soil inorganic carbon. An estimated
	global loss of 133 Pg of soil organic carbon is attributed to past land management
	practices and soil degradation. With the adoption of regenerative practices,
	[Lal (2020)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00380768.2020.1718548?needAccess=true)
	estimates that 178 Pg of soil organic carbon can be sequestered over the
	2020-2100 time horizon.

	While the long-term benefits of regenerative stewardship are unquestioned,
	the potential of regenerative agriculture to produce meaningful carbon
	sequestration in the near team continues to be vigorously debated **[Add references]**.
	Framing the debate itself is complex due to variability in its reduction to practice.
	The common approach to defining regenerative agriculture is through a
	specification of practices that, when leveraged together in a holistic
	management strategy, generate a range of positive ecological outcomes,
	such as the following specified in
	The Carbon Underground's [widely supported definition](https://thecarbonunderground.org/our-initiative/definition/)
	* Greater soil biota diversity and health
	* Increasing biodiversity above and below the soil surface
	* Increasing water holding capacity
	* Soil carbon sequestration at greater depths
	* Soil structure improvements reducing soil loss

	The set of regenerative practices producing these outcomes include
	* Minimal disturbance of the soil (no-till/minimum tillage)
	* Keeping a living root in the soil at all times
	* Diversity in cover crops and crop rotations
	* Integration of livestock with managed grazing

	Since these practices are meant to be integrated into a holistic approach
	tailored to each agricultural context, estimating the impact of a regenerative
	system a priori is fraught with complexity. Transition to regenerative
	stewardship is therefore a process of incremental innovation driven by
	continuous experimentation. Along this journey, measurement of ecological
	outcomes is absolutely critical to gauge the success of the evolving strategy.

	In support of the drive to define low-cost, scalable approaches to measure
	ecological outcomes, our objective in this work is to address a targeted
	measurement question. Can satellite-based remote sensing be leveraged to
	estimate the current state of soil carbon stocks over agricultural lands and,
	more importantly, their change over time?

	As farmers transition from conventional to regenerative practices, the rate at
	which soil health recovers is a function of the degree of their commitment.
	Most often, conventional farmers take a slow, incremental approach to mitigate
	their risk, leading to soil health restoration over a 5-7
	year time horizon. For farmers that adopt a wider spectrum of regenerative
	practices all at once, soil health recovery in 3-4 years is possible.

	Discuss the challenge of field scale SOC estimation and how that impacts defining
	ground truth estimates for regression modeling.

	Define a typical annual rate of change in terms of % SOC and translate that
	constraint into Mg/ha.

	Discuss sources of measurement uncertainty.

	Note: SOC(kg/ha) = SOC(%) × Bulk Density(g/cm3) × Sampling Depth(cm) x 1000
